        "abstract": "This paper presents a sentiment analysis combining the lexicon-based and machine learning (ML)- based approaches in Turkish to investigate the public mood for the prediction of stock market behavior in BIST30, Borsa Istanbul. Our main motivation behind this study is to apply sentiment analysis to financial-related tweets in Turkish. We import 17189 tweets posted as \"#Borsaistanbul, #Bist, #Bist30, #Bist100\u2033 on Twitter between November 7, 2022, and November 15, 2022, via a MAXQDA 2020, a qualitative data analysis program. For the lexicon-based side, we use a multilingual sentiment offered by the Orange program to label the polarities of the 17189 samples as positive, negative, and neutral labels. Neutral labels are discarded for the machine learning experiments. For the machine learning side, we select 9076 data as positive and negative to implement the classification problem with six different supervised machine learning classifiers conducted in Python 3.6 with the sklearn library. In experiments, 80 % of the selected data is used for the training phase and the rest is used for the testing and validation phase. Results of the experiments show that the Support Vector Machine and Multilayer Perceptron classifier perform better than other classifiers with 0.89 and 0.88 accuracy and AUC values of 0.8729 and 0.8647 respectively. Other classifiers obtain approximately a 78,5 % accuracy rate. It is possible to increase sentiment analysis accuracy with parameter optimization on a larger, cleaner, and more balanced dataset by changing the pre-processing steps. This work can be expanded in the future to develop better sentiment analysis using deep learning approaches.",

        "abstract": "The growth of financial texts in the wake of big data has challenged most organizations and brought escalating demands for analysis tools. In general, text streams are more challenging to handle than numeric data streams. Text streams are unstructured by nature, but they represent collective expressions that are of value in any financial decision. It can be both daunting and necessary to make sense of unstructured textual data. In this study, we address key questions related to the explosion of interest in how to extract insight from unstructured data and how to determine if such insight provides any hints concerning the trends of financial markets. A sentiment analysis engine (SAE) is proposed which takes advantage of linguistic analyses based on grammars. This engine extends sentiment analysis not only at the word token level, but also at the phrase level within each sentence. An assessment heuristic is applied to extract the collective expressions shown in the texts. Also, three evaluations are presented to assess the performance of the engine. First, several standard parsing evaluation metrics are applied on two treebanks. Second, a benchmark evaluation using a dataset of English movie review is conducted. Results show our SAE outperforms the traditional bag of words approach. Third, a financial text stream with twelve million words that aligns with a stock market index is examined. The evaluation results and their statistical significance provide strong evidence of a long persistence in the mood time series generated by the engine. In addition, our approach establishes grounds for belief that the sentiments expressed through text streams are helpful for analyzing the trends in a stock market index, although such sentiments and market indices are normally considered to be completely uncorrelated. \u2022To explain a classifier-based sentiment parser for financial texts\u2022To demonstrate how to assign the polarity of phrases using an assessment heuristic\u2022To provide statistical tests using twelve million words to attest its significance.",

In this study departing from classical econometrics we employ natural language processing technologies in combination with machine learning techniques in order to filter out the most important signals in the corpus of speeches and translate into a sentiment index for forecasting the future financial markets behaviour. In our analysis, it is evident that central banker's expectations on economy tend to exhibit a predictive ability for financial markets turmoil.

The digital currency has taken the financial markets by storm ever since its inception. Academia and industry are focussing on Artificial intelligence (AI) tools and techniques to study and gain an understanding of how businesses can draw insights from the large-scale data available online. As the market is driven by public opinions, and social media today provides an encouraging platform to share ideas and views; organizations and policy-makers could use the natural language processing (NLP) technology of AI to analyze public sentiments. Recently, a new and moderately unconventional instrument known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is emerging as an upcoming business market. Unlike the stock market, no precise quantitative parameters exist for the price determination of NFTs. Instead, NFT markets are driven more by public opinion, expectations, the perception of buyers, and the goodwill of creators. This study evaluates human emotions on the social media platforms Twitter posted by the public relating to NFTs. Additionally, this study conducts secondary market analysis to determine the reasons for the growing acceptance of NFTs through sentiment and emotion analysis. We segregate tweets using Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMCC) and study 8-scale emotions (Anger, Anticipation, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, and Trust) along with Positive and Negative sentiments. Tweets majorly contained positive sentiment (\u223c 72%), and positive emotions like anticipation and trust were found to be predominant all over the world. This is the first of its kind financial and emotional analysis of tweets pertaining to NFTs to the best of our understanding.",

        "abstract": "Deep Learning and Big Data analytics are two focal points of data science. Deep Learning models have achieved remarkable results in speech recognition and computer vision in recent years. Big Data is important for organizations that need to collect a huge amount of data like a social network and one of the greatest assets to use Deep Learning is analyzing a massive amount of data (Big Data). This advantage makes Deep Learning as a valuable tool for Big Data. Deep Learning can be used to extract incredible information that buried in a Big Data. The modern stock market is an example of these social networks. They are a popular place to increase wealth and generate income, but the fundamental problem of when to buy or sell shares, or which stocks to buy has not been solved. It is very common among investors to have professional financial advisors, but what is the best resource to support the decisions these people make? Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, and Salomon Brothers dominated the world of financial advice for more than a decade. However, via the popularity of the Internet and financial social networks such as StockTwits and SeekingAlpha, investors around the world have new opportunity to gather and share their experiences. Individual experts can predict the movement of the stock market in financial social networks with the reasonable accuracy, but what is the sentiment of a mass group of these expert authors towards various stocks? In this paper, we seek to determine if Deep Learning models can be adapted to improve the performance of sentiment analysis for StockTwits. We applied several neural network models such as long short-term memory, doc2vec, and convolutional neural networks, to stock market opinions posted in StockTwits. Our results show that Deep Learning model can be used effectively for financial sentiment analysis and a convolutional neural network is the best model to predict sentiment of authors in StockTwits dataset.",

        "abstract": "10K Financial reports are submitted by public listed companies to the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) yearly or quarterly. It allows investors to understand strategic planning and directions of the business organization. Although true facts are required to be presented in the reports, it does not prevent companies from using confusing explanations to beautify the organizations current state. Hence, an automated approach to filter out sentiments from the reports is crucial to assist investors in evaluating financial reports. This research paper explores machine learning approaches to conduct sentiment analysis on 10K financial reports. Two different datasets were intended to be used for training the model but only the financial phrase bank dataset was used to produce the final machine learning models. Four machine learning models including fastText, Na\u00efve Bayes Support Vector Machine (NBSVM), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) are trained based on the financial phrase bank dataset. It is discovered that the BERT model performed with the best accuracy while testing the models while the fastText model provided the fastest loading and training time. Conclusion of this research paper shows that different machine learning models in sentiment analysis possess respective advantages and disadvantages and further research can be done with the combination of textual and numerical data in financial reports.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the methodology of inferring bullish or bearish sentiments in the financial domain. The task aims to predict a real value to represent the sentiment intensity concerning a target (company or stock symbol) in a text. Previous researches have proved the validity of using deep neural networks to automatically learn semantic and syntactic information for sentiment prediction. Despite the promising performance, these approaches implicitly obtain the target-sentiment representation by a sentence-level vector, lacking explicitly modeling the semantic relatedness between a target and its context. In this paper, we tackle the task by a novel semantic and syntactic enhanced neural model (SSENM), which incorporates dependency graph and context words to guide a target representation. In particular, we devise a self-attentive mechanism to capture semantic contextual information and an edge-enhanced graph convolutional network (E-GCN) to aggregate node-to-node features. In addition, the existing FSA is limited in size, which is prone to the overfitting problem for modern neural models. We further develop a Manifold Mixup strategy to generate pseudo data in training. We perform extensive experiments on two public benchmarks, SemEval2017task5 and FiQA challenges. Results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art model by 2% wcs scores on SemEval2017task5 and 3% R2 scores on FiQA, respectively. Finally, we present detailed analysis to indicate the effectiveness of each proposed component. \u2022We show it is more challenging for the FSA than TBSA.\u2022SSENM employs semantic and syntactic knowledge to capture discriminative features.\u2022E-GCN enables each node representation to realize in-depth dependency connections.\u2022We integrate the model-based and data-driven approach to construct the regressor.\u2022Quality assessment methods are compared in two publicly available datasets.",
